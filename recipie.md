Instructions

Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic and onion - cook slowly for 3 to 4 minutes until onion is translucent and sweet.
Turn heat up to medium high, add zucchini and capsicum. Cook 1 1/2 minutes.
Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT pasta and broccoli. Stir until tomato paste dissolves.
When liquid starts bubbling, lower heat to medium, add pasta and stir. Top with broccoli, push in.
Place lid on and cook for 5 minutes.
Remove lid. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until pasta is almost cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta.
Stir through half the cheese (if using). Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
Top with remaining cheese, put lid on. Leave for 1 minute until cheese is melted and pasta is perfectly cooked.
Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. Don't leave leftovers in the pot, residual heat will overcook the pasta so transfer into a serving dish.
